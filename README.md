# Interference_in_CI
Causal inference with interference. STAT640 Course project. Including the code, dataset and report. 
We reproduce the paper by Forastiere, Laura, Edoardo M. Airoldi, and Fabrizia Mealli (2016). 

### Report, Slides, Paper.

Brief report with 6 pages.
Slides with 12 pages.
Original paper by Forastiere, Laura, Edoardo M. Airoldi, and Fabrizia Mealli (2016). 


### Code and Result

scenario 1: Interference1.Rmd, res_df2.csv, res_df5.csv;
scenario 2: Interference2.Rmd, res_df4.csv;

For 500 replications, generate the Y,Z,G first in the Interference*.Rmd, then run the loop.Rmd. The output is txt file.

For summarise of *.txt file, run the last chunck in Interference.Rmd.

### Dataset
